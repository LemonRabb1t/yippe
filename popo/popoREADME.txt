#intro
created sometime before the pandemic, I attempted to create a robotic owl that would sit on my shoulder. the idea was 
to attach the owl to my shoulder and have it automatially blink and spin its head (like a real one). 

Unfortunetly, I was never able to finish the owl since at the time I didn't have the funds to finish my idea. 
Perhaps I will revist this in the future
