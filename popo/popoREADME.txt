#intro
Created some time between 2015-2019, I attempted to create a robotic owl that would sit on my shoulder. 
The idea was to attach the owl to my shoulder and have it automatically blink and spin its head (like a real one), plus a button on the top of the head that would trigger the owl to maintain a forward staring and eye open stance (for pictures). 
Unfortunately, I was never able to finish the owl since at the time I didn't have the funds to finish my idea. 
Perhaps I will revisit this in the future

Created with a small servo motor, small DC motor, a small button, plastic gears from some deconstructed toy, snap-together wires, and an Arduino.
